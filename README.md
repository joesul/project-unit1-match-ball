##Technologies used
  -Javascript: functions, loops, event listeners, DOM manipulation
  -HTML: basic HTML
  -CSS: Animations

##How it works
  -the game is loaded and is awaiting input from 2 people
  -either person will use: player one - "A" to start, "S" to stop;
                           player two - "K" to start, "L" to stop;
  -the objective of the game is to start and to have your ball stop within the cylinder that is in the middle
  -the game will determine each players position within the cylinder
  -the player who is more "fully-in" the cylinder wins the game or in the case both are not in the cylinder they will both lose or if both are within they will draw

##Unsolved problems
  -the only major problem is that I could not figure out how to code the game to have the ball move if the player accidentally presses the stop key before pressing the start key
